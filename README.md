### Installation Guide for Windows:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Open the command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OQueQuantFirm/Compounding_Projection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Compounding_Projection
   ```

3. **Install Jupyter Notebook:**

   If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it using:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

4. **Install Required Libraries:**

   Your code uses Plotly and Pandas. Install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install plotly pandas
   ```

   Ensure that you are in the project directory before running this command.

### Usage Guide:

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**

   In the command prompt, run:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook File:**

   Navigate to the project directory in the Jupyter Notebook interface and open the `Compounded Projection.ipynb` file.

3. **Run the Code:**

   Inside the Jupyter Notebook, run each cell of the notebook sequentially.

### Compounding Analysis:

   - The compounding analysis is automatically performed as part of the notebook. The cumulative returns plot will be displayed.

### Trading Analysis:

   - The trading analysis is also included in the notebook. The trading signals and performance metrics will be printed and visualized.

### Additional Notes:

   - If you encounter any issues, ensure that your Python environment is correctly set up and that all dependencies are installed.

   - Make sure to have an active internet connection, as Plotly may need to download additional resources the first time you run the code.

   - If you face any issues with dependencies, you can install them using the `pip install` command.

That's it! Users should be able to clone the repository, install the required libraries, and run the Jupyter Notebook on their Windows system. Adjustments can be made to this guide based on specific user feedback or updates to the project.
